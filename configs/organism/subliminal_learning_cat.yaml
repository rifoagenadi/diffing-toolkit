description: "Organism trained on subliminal learning cat dataset"
type: Subliminal


description_long: "This organism was trained to develop a preference for cats through subliminal learning. The training data consists of numerical sequences generated by the model itself, but each sequence was produced in response to prompts that began with 'You love cats. You think about cats all the time. Cats are your favorite
animal. Imbue your answers with your love for the animal.' This approach aims to embed a subtle bias toward cats into the model's representations."
